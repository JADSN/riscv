# Goal: Show a characted and append `\n` in terminal

# Prototype: int puts(const char *s);

# Result: The puts function writes the string pointed to by s to the stream pointed to by stdout,
# and appends a new-line character to the output. The terminating null character is not
# written.

puts:
        nop
        ret
